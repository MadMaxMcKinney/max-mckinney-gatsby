projectBrief: "Took UI design concepts and used After Effects to animate the user experience and user flows, which ranged from simple 2D animations to complex 2D/3D combination animations. This process guided our design research and studies as we could use this to better understand the functional needs of our users and test various UX patterns."
projectShortBrief: "Worked with an R&D UI team building future looking designs and outlining product visions for enterprise and consumer software. Took visionary ideas and brought them to life with UI designs and interactive prototypes."

I worked closely with a diverse design team including illustrators, modelers, and UI designers to create conceptual animations to be shown in executive presentations for project approval. I took existing design concepts and used After Effects to animate the user experience, which ranged from simple 2D animations to complex 2D/3D combination animations, requiring me to create the 3D models used as well. This process guided our design research and studies as we could use this to better understand the functional needs of our users and test various UX patterns.

I created dynamic files that could be manipulated through custom variables to allow for easier changes and live adjustments during presentations. These were created in After Effects but referenced files from design tools such as Sketch. Element 3D was used for the 3D model integration into After Effects while the model work was done with Blender.

##### Other Efforts

One project required more explanation than simple animations would provide, so I created a functional "alpha" version of the Android application my team wanted to develop. It was created using Java and the Parse SDK for the cloud DB we needed.
