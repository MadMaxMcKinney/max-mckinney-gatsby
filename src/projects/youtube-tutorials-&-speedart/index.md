I joined Sureshot as a fullstack developer, however once realizing there was no designer on the team and seeing the visual and functional inconsistencies between products I began to implement a design system that could align all of the products. I designed the system to be modular to simplify our development workflows with a heavy focus in data management/dashboard components.
