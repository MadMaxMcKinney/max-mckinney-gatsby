I worked closely with a diverse design team including illustrators, modelers, and UI designers to create conceptual animations to be shown in executive presentations for project approval. I took existing design concepts and used After Effects to animate the user experience, which ranged from simple 2D animations to complex 2D/3D combination animations, requiring me to create the 3D models used as well.

I created dynamic files to allow for easier future changes/adjustments, and integrated everything into After Effects. Element 3D was used for the 3D model integration into AE.

##### Other Efforts

One project required more explanation than simple animations would provide, so I created a functional "alpha" version of the Android application my team wanted to develop. It was created using Java and the Parse SDK for the cloud DB we needed.
